<h1>Lock submitted pages</h1>

<p>This setting allows you to lock the submitted pages or collections in Mahara, preventing
their owners from editing them. This may be useful, for example, to prevent a student from
doing further work on their submitted page after the assignment deadline.</p>

<p>If "Yes, keep locked" is selected, submitted Mahara pages and collections will be locked
from editing in Mahara, and will remain locked after grading until a teacher manually unlocks
via the Moodle gradebook.</p>

<p>If "Yes, but unlock after grading" is selected, the page or collection will be unlocked 
after submission is graded.</p>
