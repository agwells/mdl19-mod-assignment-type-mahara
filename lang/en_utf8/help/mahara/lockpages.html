<h1>Lock submitted pages</h1>

<p>This setting allows you to lock the submitted pages or collections in Mahara, preventing
their owners from editing them. This may be useful, for example, to prevent a student from
doing further work on their submitted page after the assignment deadline.</p>

<p>If "Yes, keep locked" is selected, submitted Mahara pages and collections will be locked
from editing in Mahara, and will remain permanently locked in Mahara even after grading.
This may be useful if you need a more permanent record of the submitted work.</p>

<p>If "Yes, but unlock after grading" is selected, the page or collection will be unlocked 
after submission is graded.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some Mahara page content may still be editable even after the page
is locked. For example, the content in embedded iframes may be updated, external RSS feeds
may update, and blogs may gain additional entries.</p>
